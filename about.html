                    <h1>Browsing Youtube</h1>
                    <p>
                        I like to watch many youtubers, but lately I've been watching a lot of 
                        Caleb Hammer's financial audits. Trust me, it's more entertaining than 
                        you think it is. It also helps you rethink your spending habits and can 
                        make you more financially literate.

                    <h1>Reading Webnovels</h1>
                    <p>
                        I spend way too much time reading webnovels, but there never seems to be 
                        a day where I can't find a novel that catches my interest. This hobby of 
                        mine is more of an aquired taste as many people hate reading.

                    <p>
                        My friends and I are always up to random shenanigans in any game you can
                        think of. Recently we've picked up Apex Legends again(After losing 
                        interest for a while). Incidentally, this has become the extent of my
                        social life since highschool ended.

                    <h1>Listening to music</h1>
                    <p>
                        I listen to a very wide range of music and I have over 650 liked songs
                        on spotify. Don't underestimate that number, it's many, many hours of
                        music, and I like to spend the entire day just listening. I always
                        have an earbud in anywhere I go, and you can bet I'm jamming out.
